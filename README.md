# seo-content-clusters

A Qoder Skill for planning SEO topic clusters and eliminating **keyword cannibalization**, so
exactly one page wins each query.

The core discipline: build a clean query-ownership map *before* touching content, with a
sitemap + query-intent **fallback audit for when you have no Search Console access**. Also covers
topic-cluster architecture, on-page checklists, link-authority plans, and hreflang / language
hygiene.

## What it does

- **Query ownership rule** — the page with the most clicks/impressions owns a keyword; no two pages
  share a primary keyword in title + H1.
- **Cannibalization audit as a blocker** — a mandatory gate before content changes, with GSC and
  pre-GSC templates.
- **Cluster architecture** — pillar + satellite mapping by search intent.
- **On-page + link-authority checklists** and **hreflang reciprocity** pitfalls.
- Stays complementary to `seo-audit` (technical diagnosis) and `programmatic-seo` (page scale).
